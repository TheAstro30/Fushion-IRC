- Need to test libDirectX and make changes to depreciated methods (third party code)
- Need to refactor/fix up all code/re-organize "SyntaxHighlight" folder for FastColoredTextBox
  (third party code) - complete 25/04/19
- Need to fix paths in script editor for files (hard coded to \scripts\ <- needs to change)
- Need to add a "Save As" option to script editor
- Need to modify the "live" script data from two separate lists (Popups (which will
  probably be changed now to "Events") and Aliases) to a single list (not using a Dictionary<Key, T>
  as this only allows ONE unique key) referenced by ScriptFileNodeType (renamed to ScriptType). This will
  mean that all scripts/aliases are in one location which will simply the editor code and script building code.
  GetScript(string name) would be changed to GetScript(ScriptType type, name) when called. The only problem I'm going 
  to have, is multiple scripts with the same "signature" (name). Eg: ON *:CONNECT:. All scripts would have to be executed
  on that event, so would mean a loop ... aliases are a different matter.
- Aliases also need to be checked as $identifiers with return values (TO DO) - that has been done, to a point 27/04/2019
